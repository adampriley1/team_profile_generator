# team_profile_generator

Description
The challenge was to build a Team Profile generator using node, Inquirer and testing with Jest

Requirements:
To take the given starter code and convert it into a working Node.js command-line application. This application will take in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I was provided with tests, to allow me to ensure every part of the code passes each provided test.

When the user type node index.js into the command line. They will be prompted to add a manager. They will then have options to add multiple engineers and . or interns to the team.
